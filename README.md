Hi, Iâ€™m MichaeI Franklin

What I have done:
- Being the sole client side mobile developer at Telvida, I've worked on many projects either by myself or along side the company's server side developer/Owner. 
- One of my favorite projects was a fully user customizable and dynamic digital signage system built using java to run natively on a custom android firmware box. 
- Another great project was a web based cross platform video chat and messaging prototype built using Ionic and Cordova frameworks on top of a typescript base. 
- I've learned tons at this past job including native android and some iOS development and deployment, cross-platform web based development, and how to deliver excellent quality products while on my own.
- I've kept my skills sharp in between employments by offering my skills to others as a freelance developer. Developing everything from maintenance scripts to small video game applications.

What makes my tick:
- I value creative thinking
- the determination to never give up
- and the integrity to never "slide by"
These standards I hold myself to allow me to produce new and innovative software while helping to keep my own and my colleagues' spirits high even during in the midst of challenges. 

I bring to the team:
- My skills as a developer.
- My innovation as an out of the box thinker.
- My always optimistic attitude as an integrity driven, "never give up", person that I am.

What I am looking for:
- I am wanting to work with a skilled team of individuals to create something unique and beneficial for others.
